# Continuous Deployemtn with Ansible and Docker

This template demonstrates how to use ansible and docker to automatically deploy a web service to a remote server from gitlab.

## The Web Service

The web service to be deployed is not included in this template. For demonstration services the configuration assumes that the service will be deployed in four parts:

* client: a website, bundled as a docker container
* server: a backend server, also bundled as a docker container
* mongo: database server based on the official docker container
* haproxy: proxy server based on the haproxy-letsencrypt docker container (includes automatic and free ssl certificate generation for your domain)

The template can be easily extended to deploy additional docker containers, like a backup script, a static website or multiple backend services, by adding new roles for each container and editing the haproxy configuration file as needed.

## Ansible

Ansible is used to install and maintain the docker containers on your servers. The folder `ansible/` holds the ansible configuration. There are two playbooks:

* `setup` sets up a new debian server
* `update` installs and updates the components of our web service

The hosts are specified in `config/inventory`. SSH keys are placed in `config/ssh`.

There are 5 roles:

* `client` installs a simple docker container with no dependencies (the client should access the backend via the proxy server)
* `common` sets up new debian box with docker (this will need some tweaking depending on your setup and distribution)
* `haproxy` installs the proxy server. The configuration file contained might need some tweaking for your setup.
* `mongo` installs the database server. It is accessible from localhost via port 27017 and can be linked to other containers. It is not accessible from external hosts.
* `server` install another docker container with a dependency to the mongo container

The script `run` is used as the entrypoint for the docker container described below.

## Docker

Docker is used to create a docker container from this repository. This docker container can be used to execute deployment tasks from a CI such as gitlab-ci.

The docker configuration is stored in `Dockerfile`. It is based on a docker container by Jens BÃ¶ttcher, which is appropriate for usage with Gitlab's CI.

To build the container run `docker build -t my-ansible .`. Then you can execute a playbook by running e.g. `docker run my-ansible update`.

## Gitlab CI

`gitlab-ci.yml` contains a sample configuration to automatically build this container. It also contains two manual tasks that can be triggered to call either playbook.

`gitlab-ci.client.yml` contains a sample configuration for the client. You need to fill in how to build your client and add a Dockerfile. Then the client is containerized and pushed to the gitlab registry. Finally, the deploy step will use the ansible container from this repository to deploy the client on your server.
